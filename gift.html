          <h3>WASH & CUT - £35</h3>
          <p>A detailed consultation with one of our stylists will review lifestyle, grooming regime and any other requirements. This is followed with a relaxing shampoo and haircut and finished with a blow-dry and style if desired.

Our expertly trained barbers will be able to advise you as to which styles and lengths will suit your face shape, hair colour, thickness and condition.
